<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>Hello! My name is Ryan Regnier, and I’m 37 years old, currently living in Whitehorse, Yukon. Originally from Vancouver, BC, I’ve spent most of my life working in metal fabrication and CNC machining, where I developed a deep appreciation for precision and problem-solving.</p>

<p>While I’ve enjoyed working in the trades, I’m now looking to make a career shift and embrace new challenges. I’ve recently started exploring the world of web development, and I’m currently taking a full stack web development course on Udemy to gain the skills I need to transition into this exciting field.</p>

<p>This website is part of my learning journey, and I’m excited to combine my hands-on experience with my new knowledge in coding. I look forward to what the future holds as I continue to grow and develop in this new direction!</p>
