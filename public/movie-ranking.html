<h2>My Top 3 Movies of 2024</h2>
<hr />
<h3>1: Alien Romulus</h3>
<p>Great atmosphere and vibe. Throwback to 80's Sci-Fi. Saw this film in a theatre Japan while traveling with my brother. The movie was in English but with Japanese subtitles. </p>
<h3>2: Beetlejuice Beetlejuice</h3>
<p>Another nostaligic remake/sequel. I have always thought that Michael Keaton as Beetlejuice would only get better as he aged, and I was right! Funny moments with the classic Tim Burton style. I also saw this movie while traveling this time in Thailand. Going out to the movies in Thailand is an amazing experience. Luxury theaters and seating, refills and snacks provided by a waiter before the movie started. Definitly the most comfortable theatre I have been too.</p>
<h3>3: Ricky Stanicky</h3>
<p>A very funny comedy that I did not expect. John Cena steals most of the film with most of the memorable punchlines and goofs. I watched this one at home on my couch, with my GF and our pets. </p>
